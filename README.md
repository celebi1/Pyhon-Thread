This code creates two threads (t1 and t2) that run the worker function concurrently. 
The worker function simply increments a counter every second and prints a message containing a specified text (either "ABC" or "XYZ") along with the current value of the counter. 
The main thread waits for both t1 and t2 to finish using the join() method before prompting the user to press Enter to quit the program. 
The done variable is set to True after the user presses Enter, but it doesn't have any effect on the program's behavior since it's not used anywhere else in the code.
